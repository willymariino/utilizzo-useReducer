# To-Do List with useReducer

This project demonstrates how to use React's `useReducer` hook to manage complex state in a to-do list application. Instead of handling state updates with multiple separate functions, all logic for adding, toggling, deleting, and cloning tasks is centralized in a reducer function. This approach makes state management more predictable and easier to maintain as your application grows.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Toggle task completion
- Delete tasks
- Clone tasks
